          I'm proactive and results oriented self-taught web development
          enthusiast, I have a keen interest in emerging technology and key
          strengths in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.Js (Express), MongoDB.
        </p>

        <p>
          In addition to my professional qualifications, I have also recently
          completed the ‘The Web Developer Bootcamp’ with Udemy, and I use my
          free time to refine these skills wherever I can. In parallel, I have
          proactively sought work experience where I can utilise my computer
          knowledge whilst developing my interpersonal and communication skills.
          I am now looking for a Junior Web Developer or Software Engineer role,
          where I can continue to learn and develop, whilst adding value to my
          team.
